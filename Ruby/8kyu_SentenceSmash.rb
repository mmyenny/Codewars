# Sentence Smash
# Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

# Example
# words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']
# smash(words) # returns "hello world this is great"
# Assumptions
# You can assume that you are only given words.
# You cannot assume the size of the array.
# You can assume that you will always get an array.

def smash(words)
  words.join(" ")
end
